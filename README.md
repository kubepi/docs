## Distributions

Several distributions were trialled for use in this project. They include:

- Hypriot - Found it didn't work and is not maintained.
- Ubuntu-Mate
- Unbuntu Core - Minimal distro. Required to install a classic mode to access common features. Ran into multiple issues as a result of this, so moved on.
- Unbuntu (arm version)
